# EXCEL-PROJECT 

An interactive Excel Sales Dashboard built using the Superstore dataset to analyze sales performance across regions, time, and customer segments.

The dashboard highlights key KPIs including Total Sales, Transactions, and Quantity Ordered, with slicers for region and year to enable quick drill-down analysis.

This project demonstrates strong skills in data cleaning, pivot tables, pivot charts, slicers, and business-focused reporting, with an emphasis on turning raw data into actionable insights.
